========================= Experimental =========================

**This project is currently in an experimental stage.**

## What This Means

- This repository operates like any other public GitHub repository.
- Contributions are unlikely to be accepted during this stage.
- Issues may not receive immediate attention.
- This repository could be removed without extensive notice.

## Why?

At this juncture, the repository is in the proof-of-concept phase and might be
considered less valuable or more challenging to maintain than warranted by my
available time. The decision to not accept contributions is primarily rooted in
the understanding that this could require significant time investment, coupled
with the potential risk of removal. I aim to respect your time and efforts.

## What If You Find It Useful?

If you find value in this project, I encourage you to clone or fork the
repository as a safeguard against potential removal.

## What This Means for the Future

One of two scenarios awaits:

1. The repository will be deleted. In some cases, a notice may be added to the
   readme a few days before removal.
2. If the project proves its worth and garners sustained interest, it might
   transition to regular support status. Learn more about support [here](https://github.com/FredHappyface/.github/blob/master/SUPPORT.md).

Your understanding and potential contributions during this experimental phase
are greatly appreciated.
