========================= Experimental =========================

**This project is currently experimental**

## What this means

- This repository behaves as any other public repository on GitHub
- Contributions are unlikely to be accepted during this stage
- Issues will likely be ignored during this stage
- This repository could be removed with little to no notice

## Why?

At this point in time the repo is at the proof-of-concept stage and may be
deemed to be useless or more challenging to maintain than is worth my time.
Contributions are likely not accepted largely due to the fact that this may
take time and there is a reasonable risk of removal - I don't wish to waste
your time.

## What if you find it useful?

I would urge you to clone/ fork the repo in case it gets removed

## What this means in the future

One of two things will happen
- The repository will be deleted (in some cases a notice may be added to the
readme outlining this for a few days before removal)
- The repository is deemed worth the time and effort and moves to regular
support status (find out more
