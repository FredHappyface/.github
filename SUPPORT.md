# Support

Hello!

Thank you for using this project, I hope it is of use to you. Please be aware
that those involved with the project often do so for fun along with other
commitments (such as work, family, etc) and you are therefore not entitled
to free customer service (that is not to say that contributions/ issues
and questions are not welcome - more reminding you that project maintainers are
well within their rights to prioritize other issues).

## Issues

### Questions, Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Please see https://github.com/FredHappyface/.github/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
for more information on how best to structure any issues. Please be sure to
read through existing issues before creating your own and provide enough
information, issues like "it doesn't work" will be closed.

## Contributions - i.e. Supporting Development

Contributions are certainly welcome. Please be aware that they are not
guaranteed to be accepted. Be sure to open an issue asking if the pull request
would be accepted to avoid/ reduce the frustration that may be caused in the
case of putting in significant time and effort for a contribution not to be
accepted.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to contribute.

## Support Process

Some projects may start at an experimental stage (see below for more information)

```none
Experimental -> Regular Support -> Archived -> Deleted
                                            -> Regular Support (Very Unlikely)
             -> Deleted
```

Or

Many projects will skip the experimental stage and you can therefore expect an
increased level of support (or at the very minimum some notice before the
project is removed if it reaches the end of support)

```none
Regular Support -> Archived -> Deleted
                            -> Regular Support (Very Unlikely)
```

### Experimental

This can be best described as the alpha stage of a project and there will be
**Experimental** quite prominently displayed. Some projects may skip this
completely, it depends upon the size of the project and if I deem it to be
ready for public consumption. In the case of a project being experimental,
consider the following

#### What this means

- This repository behaves as any other public repository on GitHub
- Contributions are unlikely to be accepted during this stage
- Issues will likely be ignored during this stage
- This repository could be removed with little to no notice

#### Why?

At this point in time the repo is at the proof-of-concept stage and may be
deemed to be useless or more challenging to maintain than is worth my time.
Contributions are likely not accepted largely due to the fact that this may
take time and there is a reasonable risk of removal - I don't wish to waste
your time.

#### What if you find it useful?

I would urge you to clone/ fork the repo in case it gets removed

#### What this means in the future

One of two things will happen

- The repository will be deleted (in some cases a notice may be added to the
readme outlining this for a few days before removal)
- The repository is deemed worth the time and effort and moves to regular
support status (find out more
https://github.com/FredHappyface/.github/blob/master/SUPPORT.md)

### Regular Support

This is best described as the beta and maintenance stages of a project

#### What this means

- The project behaves exactly as one may expect. At this stage contributions are
very welcome.

#### What this means in the future

One of two things will happen:

- The repository will continue to exist in this state (Yay!)
- The repository reaches the end of support and moves to an archived state

#### Reduce the chance of a project being archived

Projects that seemingly have little interest are most likely to be archived. I
use a few mechanisms to determine this (each with their merits and drawbacks)

- Number of GitHub stars and forks
- Number of downloads/ installs (for instance pypi.org installs)
- Reviews
- Project traffic as calculated by Python.ActiveGithub

This is because I tend to have lots of project ideas (again some are more useful
than others) and limited time to maintain these.

Essentially, if you do find a project to be useful, engage with it in some
measurable way and it will stick around for a good long time.

### Archived

This stage is reached when maintenance ceases on regular projects (not
experimental)

#### What this means now

- The repository, issues, pull requests, labels, milestones, projects, wiki,
releases, commits, tags, branches, reactions and comments are read-only.
- The repository can still be forked and cloned - The License still applies.

#### What this means in the future

- The repository is scheduled for deletion after three months
- The repository will be unregistered from Codacy and CI/CD after one month
- The repository may be un-archived (however, this is very unlikely)

## Versioning

Versioning is most often done as follows:

```none
FullYear.Version.BugFix
```
