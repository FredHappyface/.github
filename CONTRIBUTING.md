# How to Contribute

Welcome to our project! Your contributions are valuable and help improve the
project for everyone. Below, you'll find guidelines for various types of contributions.

## Found a Bug?

- Check if the bug has been reported by searching existing Issues.
- If not found, open a new Issue with a descriptive title and clear description.
- Include relevant information and, if possible, a code sample or test case.

## Fixed a Bug?

- Great! Open a new Pull Request (PR) on GitHub with your fix.
- Describe the problem and solution in the PR description, referencing the
  relevant Issue if applicable.

## Cosmetic Changes?

Cosmetic changes like whitespace or formatting adjustments are appreciated, but
substantial changes that improve readability, stability, functionality, or
testability are preferred.

## Adding a New Feature or Making Changes?

- For new features or changes, open an Issue to discuss your proposal.
- Alternatively, you can submit a PR directly if you're confident about the change.

## Have Questions?

- If you have questions about the source code, feel free to open an Issue.
- Please note that Issues are mainly for bugs and fixes, but we'll do our best to
  assist you.

Your contributions make a difference! Thank you for being a part of the project. :heart:
