## Did you find a bug?

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.
Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information
as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the
expected behaviour that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include
the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the
readability, stability, functionality, or testability of a project are likely
not to be accepted.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- Open an issue on GitHub or go ahead and submit a pull request.

## Do you have questions about the source code?

- Feel free to open an issue. Please note that they are mainly intended for
bugs and fixes, and these will be prioritized.

Thank you! :heart: :heart: :heart:
