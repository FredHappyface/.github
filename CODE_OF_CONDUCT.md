## Why Have a Code of Conduct?

Our project welcomes individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. To
ensure a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone, we've established
this Code of Conduct.

The Code of Conduct serves several purposes:

1. To set a standard for respectful communication and collaboration among community members.
2. To provide a framework for resolving conflicts or misunderstandings in a constructive manner.
3. To foster a diverse and vibrant community that benefits from varied experiences and viewpoints.

## Where Does the Code of Conduct Apply?

The Code of Conduct applies to all interactions within our project ecosystem.
This includes, but is not limited to, GitHub repositories, code reviews, and
discussions.

## Values

Our community values guide our interactions and behavior:

- Be friendly, welcoming, and patient, considering diverse communication styles.
- Be thoughtful and respectful in your communication, understanding the impact of your words.
- Embrace different opinions and engage in constructive discussions.
- Avoid destructive behaviors, such as derailing conversations or making offensive remarks.
- Interpret others' arguments in good faith, seeking understanding even when disagreements arise.

Remember that a healthy community encourages open debate while maintaining respect for one another.

## Unwelcome Behaviour

The following behaviors are not tolerated within our community spaces:

- Insults, hate speech, or threats.
- Discrimination based on personal characteristics.
- Bullying, harassment, or unwelcome advances.
- Incitement to engage in harmful activities.

## Moderation

Our community spaces prioritize respectful and productive discussions related
to the project. If your behavior violates our Code of Conduct, you will receive
a warning and be asked to cease the behavior. If violations continue, temporary
or permanent removal from the community may occur.

## Reporting Issues

For conduct-related concerns, the project maintainers are responsible for
resolution. If you encounter such an issue, please report it by opening an issue.

Our aim is to address issues harmoniously, fostering positive resolutions through
discussion. Strong measures, such as bans, are considered as a last resort.

## Summary

- Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
- Communicate thoughtfully and constructively.
- Avoid harmful behaviors that hinder productive discussions.
- Report issues to the maintainers for resolution.
