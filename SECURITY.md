## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

The security of our project is of paramount importance. If you discover a
security vulnerability, we appreciate your responsible disclosure. Here's
how to proceed:

1. **Create an Issue**: Use the GitHub Issue system to report the security
   vulnerability. Public disclosure helps ensure transparency and allows more
   eyes on the code.
2. **Merge Request (Optional)**: If you're able and willing, you can submit a
   merge request with a proposed fix for the vulnerability. Your contribution
   will be valued and acknowledged.

We aim to acknowledge your report within 7 days. You can expect a more detailed
response during this time, outlining the next steps for handling the report.

For vulnerabilities in third-party modules, please report them to the
maintainers of the respective modules.

## Remediation Policy

We follow a systematic approach to address security vulnerabilities:

1. **Confirmation and Assessment**: We validate and determine the affected versions and components.
2. **Code Audit**: We perform a thorough code audit to identify any similar vulnerabilities.
3. **Fix Preparation**: We prepare fixes for all active and maintained releases as swiftly as possible.

## Feedback and Improvements

We value your input in making our security procedures even better. If you have
suggestions for improving this process, please feel free to submit a pull
request with your proposed changes.

Thank you for your dedication to the security of our project.

**Note**: The details of this policy may change over time, but the commitment to
security will remain consistent.
